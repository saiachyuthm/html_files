<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%;clear:left">Practiceing HTML is fun.<em>So far</em> we have learned <strong>HTML</strong> is a language made of tags 
that help us describe how we want our webpages to look. We have tried the head,
title,H (heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tags in 
<b>HTML</b>, but that is okay because we can do alot with just basic tags. We can 
learn about new tags when we need them.</p>
